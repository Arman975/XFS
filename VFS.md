# VFS
The Virtual File System (VFS) is an abstraction layer within operating systems that provides a standardized interface for interacting with various file systems. It abstracts the differences between file systems, offering a uniform way for applications to access and manage files without needing knowledge of specific file system details.

Key functionalities of VFS include abstracting system calls related to file operations, managing common file system operations like file creation, deletion, reading, and writing, and facilitating mounting and unmounting of file systems within the system tree.

VFS employs in-memory data structures to represent file system-related information, interacts with file system-specific modules or drivers, and manages file descriptors and tables to keep track of open files and associated metadata.

By providing interoperability, portability, and extensibility, VFS allows different file systems to coexist seamlessly, enhances application portability across operating systems, and enables the integration of new file systems into the system without major modifications to existing applications.

#Code interaction with VFS in linux kernel:
#include <linux/fs.h>
#include <linux/module.h>
#include <linux/kernel.h>

static int __init my_init(void) {
    struct file *filep;
    // Open a file in read mode
    filep = filp_open("/path/to/file.txt", O_RDONLY, 0);
    if (IS_ERR(filep)) {
        printk(KERN_ERR "Failed to open file!\n");
        return PTR_ERR(filep);
    }
    // File opened successfully, perform operations...

    // Close the file
    filp_close(filep, NULL);
    return 0;
}

static void __exit my_exit(void) {
    // Module exit cleanup
}

module_init(my_init);
module_exit(my_exit);
